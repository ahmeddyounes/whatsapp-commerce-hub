# C00-04 — Bootstrap: ErrorHandler boot sequencing

Refactor `Core\\ErrorHandler` initialization so it does not require the container too early and does not call missing services when WP is not fully ready. Prefer injecting `LoggerInterface` via provider boot. Acceptance: no container access during file load; fatal/exception handling still logs; unit tests cover init/reset paths.
