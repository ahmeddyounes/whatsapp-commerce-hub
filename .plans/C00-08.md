# C00-08 — Settings: eliminate direct `get_option('wch_settings')` usage

Audit `includes/` for direct option reads and migrate them to `SettingsInterface` (or a dedicated repository) so config is centralized. Acceptance: `rg \get_option\\(\\s*'wch_settings'\" includes` returns zero (or only within SettingsManager); behavior unchanged."
