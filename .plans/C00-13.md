# C00-13 — Queue: pick one async system and enforce it

Decide and implement a single async pipeline (recommended: `Queue\\PriorityQueue` + processors with wrapped payloads). Deprecate or adapt `Infrastructure\\Queue\\QueueManager`/`JobDispatcher` to the same conventions. Acceptance: all scheduled jobs use one payload format; all job handlers receive the expected args shape.
