# C00-14 — Queue: audit Action Scheduler hook signatures

Audit every `add_action('wch_*', ...)` handler to ensure its function signature matches the scheduled payload structure (including wrapped payloads). Fix mismatches and add minimal runtime assertions/logs in processors. Acceptance: no job crashes due to args shape; add tests for at least the webhook jobs.
