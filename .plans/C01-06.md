# C01-06 — DI discipline: reduce `wch()` service locator usage

Remove `wch()` usage from providers and internal services where possible; use constructor injection and explicit `$container` usage. Keep global helpers only at integration boundaries. Acceptance: fewer hidden dependencies; tests can instantiate services without globals.
