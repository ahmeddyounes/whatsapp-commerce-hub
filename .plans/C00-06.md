# C00-06 — Settings: deprecate `wch.settings` flat schema

Replace the flat `wch.settings`/`wch.setting` schema in `Providers\\CoreServiceProvider` with a compatibility adapter over `SettingsInterface` (sectioned keys like `api.whatsapp_phone_number_id`). Add deprecation notes in code/docs. Acceptance: all settings reads can be routed through `SettingsInterface`; legacy helpers still work during transition.
