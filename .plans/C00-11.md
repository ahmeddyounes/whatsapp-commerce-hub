# C00-11 — DB: add missing tables used at runtime

Add schema + install/uninstall support for missing tables currently referenced in code: `wch_rate_limits`, `wch_security_log`, `wch_webhook_idempotency`, and `wch_webhook_events` (and any others found in the table inventory). Acceptance: enabling Security/RateLimiter/Idempotency/Payment webhooks does not hit missing-table errors.
