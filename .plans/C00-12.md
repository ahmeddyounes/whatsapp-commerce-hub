# C00-12 — DB: uninstall cleanup completeness

Update `uninstall.php` / `DatabaseManager::uninstall()` to remove newly added tables and related options/transients safely (without deleting user data unexpectedly beyond documented scope). Acceptance: uninstall leaves no plugin tables/options behind per policy; behavior documented.
