# C00-01 — Bootstrap: remove missing Features references

In `whatsapp-commerce-hub.php`, remove/replace runtime references to non-existent `WhatsAppCommerceHub\\Features\\*` classes (e.g., RefundService, OrderNotifications, ReengagementService). Use the real services/providers that exist in this repo. Acceptance: plugin loads without PHP fatal; `rg 'WhatsAppCommerceHub\\\\Features\\\\' whatsapp-commerce-hub.php` returns no matches; activation succeeds.
