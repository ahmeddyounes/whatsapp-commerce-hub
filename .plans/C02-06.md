# C02-06 — Module: Checkout vs Saga responsibilities

Clarify the relationship between `Checkout\\CheckoutOrchestrator`, `Application\\Services\\Checkout\\CheckoutOrchestrator`, and `Sagas\\CheckoutSaga`. Remove/confine overlap and fix alias naming conflicts. Acceptance: one clear entrypoint for checkout orchestration; no ambiguous aliases.
