# C00-10 — DB: implement a real migrations mechanism

Populate `includes/Infrastructure/Database/Migrations/` with a migration interface/base and wire it into `DatabaseManager` so schema changes are versioned and testable. Acceptance: migrations run in order; DB version is updated; migrations are idempotent via `dbDelta` where appropriate.
