# C00-03 — Bootstrap: requirements gating

Ensure requirements checks (PHP/WP/WC) happen before container/provider boot and before any WooCommerce-dependent services run. Keep admin notice behavior consistent. Acceptance: on unmet requirements, plugin does not boot container, does not register hooks that assume WC; shows a single admin notice.
