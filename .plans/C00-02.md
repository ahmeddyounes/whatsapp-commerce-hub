# C00-02 — Bootstrap: single initialization path

Consolidate plugin initialization so providers own initialization; reduce/remove duplicated work in `WhatsAppCommerceHubPlugin::init()` and avoid initializing the same subsystems both in providers and the singleton. Acceptance: no double-init of admin pages, queues, or schedulers; one clear boot path documented; tests still pass.
