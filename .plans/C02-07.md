# C02-07 — Module: Payments architecture cleanup

Unify payment gateway registration, webhooks, refunds, and notifications. Fix `PaymentServiceProvider` duplication/confusion around NotificationService registration and ensure PaymentWebhookController persistence/idempotency is backed by schema. Acceptance: payment flows are consistent; no dead code paths; docs updated.
