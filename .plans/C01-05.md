# C01-05 — Logging: standardize on `LoggerInterface` injection

Refactor services/providers to depend on `Contracts\\Services\\LoggerInterface` rather than `Logger::instance()` or ad-hoc anonymous loggers. Keep fallbacks only in Core where necessary. Acceptance: logging calls are consistent; improved testability.
