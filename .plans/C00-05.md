# C00-05 — Container: resolve alias/binding collisions

Audit container bindings/aliases for collisions (e.g., duplicate `'wch.checkout'` registrations in different providers) and fix by renaming aliases or removing duplicates. Add a lightweight guard (dev-only) that can detect duplicate alias usage during provider registration. Acceptance: no duplicated alias keys across providers; container boot is deterministic.
