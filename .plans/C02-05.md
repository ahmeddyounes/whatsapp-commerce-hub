# C02-05 — Module: Product Sync boundaries and contracts

Tighten Product Sync wiring (validator/transformer/api/tracker/orchestrator/admin UI). Ensure queue hooks match payload shapes and settings keys are consistent. Acceptance: Product Sync can run end-to-end; admin UI uses Application services; docs updated.
