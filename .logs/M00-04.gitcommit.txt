- Phone validation with E.164 format sanitization
- Standardized error responses with codes and details
- Pagination headers (X-WP-Total, X-WP-TotalPages, Link)
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- OpenAPI/Swagger compatible structure

Files Added:

  Abstract base controller with reusable methods
- includes/class-wch-rest-api.php (159 lines)
  REST API manager with route registration
