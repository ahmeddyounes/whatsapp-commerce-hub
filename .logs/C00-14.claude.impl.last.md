Perfect! Task C00-14 has been completed successfully. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Implementation Complete: C00-14

I've successfully audited and fixed all Action Scheduler hook signatures to ensure they properly handle wrapped v2 payloads. Here's what was done:

### Handlers Fixed (4 total)

1. **EventServiceProvider::processAsyncEvent** (includes/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php:163)
   - Changed signature from 2 separate params to single array param
   - Added unwrapping logic and validation
   - Updated hook registration to accept 1 parameter

2. **ReengagementServiceProvider::handleSendMessage** (includes/Providers/ReengagementServiceProvider.php:197)
   - Added unwrapPayload() helper method
   - Handler now unwraps before processing

3. **RecoveryService::processRecoveryMessage** (includes/Features/AbandonedCart/RecoveryService.php:148)
   - Added inline unwrapping logic
   - Validates and extracts cart_id and sequence

4. **InventorySyncService::processStockSync** (includes/Application/Services/InventorySyncService.php:151)
   - Changed signature from `int $productId` to `array $args`
   - Added unwrapping and product_id extraction

### Tests Created (3 test files)

1. **WebhookProcessorTest** - Tests for all webhook processors with wrapped/unwrapped payloads
2. **EventServiceProviderTest** - Tests for async event processing
3. **InventorySyncServiceTest** - Tests for stock sync job processing

All tests verify that handlers properly handle both v2 wrapped payloads and legacy unwrapped payloads without crashes.

### Common Pattern

All fixes follow a consistent pattern:
- Check for `_wch_version === 2`
- Extract `$payload['args']` if wrapped
- Use payload as-is if legacy
- Add debug/error logging for validation
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ No job crashes due to args shape  
✅ Minimal runtime assertions/logs in processors  
✅ Tests for webhook jobs  

All changes are documented in `.logs/C00-14-implementation-summary.md`.
