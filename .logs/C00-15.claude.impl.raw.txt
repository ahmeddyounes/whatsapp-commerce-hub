Now let me check if there are any verification commands I should run:\n\nThe spec mentions no specific verification commands (format, lint, test are all empty), so let me create a summary of the changes:\n\n## Status: DONE\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI have successfully implemented C00-15 by creating comprehensive documentation for the plugin's boot sequence.\n\n### Files Created:\n1. **`docs/boot-sequence.md`** - A detailed documentation file describing:\n   - The three-phase initialization approach (Requirements → Container/Providers → Context-Specific Boot)\n   - Phase 1: Requirements validation (PHP 8.1+, WordPress 6.0+, WooCommerce 8.0+)\n   - Phase 2: Container initialization and service provider registration/boot\n   - Detailed explanation of all 20 service providers in registration order\n   - Phase 3: Context-specific runtime behavior for conversation management\n   - Key architectural patterns (fail-fast, two-phase initialization, dependency injection, provider ordering, immutable context, singleton pattern)\n   - Database schema initialization\n   - Extension points for third-party developers\n   - Complete boot sequence flow diagram\n   \n### Files Modified:\n1. **`docs/README.md`** - Added link to the new boot sequence documentation in the \"For Developers\" section\n\n### Documentation Accuracy:\nAll references in the documentation are to **real files and classes** in the codebase:\n- `whatsapp-commerce-hub.php` (main plugin file with line references)\n- `includes/Container/Container.php` (PSR-11 container)\n- `includes/Container/ServiceProviderInterface.php` (provider interface)\n- All 20 service providers in `includes/Providers/`\n- `includes/ValueObjects/ConversationContext.php` (conversation state)\n- `includes/Application/Services/ContextManagerService.php` (context persistence)\n- `includes/Infrastructure/Database/DatabaseManager.php` (schema management)\n\n## How to Verify\n\n1. **Read the documentation**:\n   ```bash\n   cat docs/boot-sequence.md\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify the link was added to README**:\n   ```bash\n   grep \"Boot Sequence\" docs/README.md\n   ```\n\n3. **Confirm all referenced files exist**:\n   ```bash\n   ls -l whatsapp-commerce-hub.php\n   ls -l includes/Container/Container.php\n   ls -l includes/Providers/*.php | wc -l  # Should show 20 providers\n   ls -l includes/ValueObjects/ConversationContext.php\n   ls -l includes/Application/Services/ContextManagerService.php\n   ls -l includes/Infrastructure/Database/DatabaseManager.php\n   ```\n\n4. **Review the boot sequence flow matches the code**:\n   - Check main plugin file line 404-426 for plugins_loaded hook\n   - Check line 295-330 for requirements validation\n   - Check line 85-144 for container initialization\n   - Check line 94-126 for provider registration order\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n**Risks**: None. This is pure documentation with no code changes.\n\n**Follow-ups**:\n- Consider creating additional diagrams (sequence diagrams, class diagrams) to visualize the boot process\n- Add examples of common extension scenarios using the documented hooks\n- Link to this boot sequence doc from other developer docs (api-reference.md, extending.md, hooks-reference.md) where relevant\n- Consider adding troubleshooting section for common boot-related issues","session_id":"e1182675-881d-435c-a67d-bebc43fa8d5e","total_cost_usd":0.54424115,"usage":{"input_tokens":227,"cache_creation_input_tokens":27131,"cache_read_input_tokens":587670,"output_tokens":6368,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":27131}},"modelUsage":{"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":227,"outputTokens":6368,"cacheReadInputTokens":587670,"cacheCreationInputTokens":27131,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.37424325,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":11792,"outputTokens":5389,"cacheReadInputTokens":411509,"cacheCreationInputTokens":72088,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.16999789999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"a6976e47-a5cd-45ac-9886-7e2f2943bf8d"}
