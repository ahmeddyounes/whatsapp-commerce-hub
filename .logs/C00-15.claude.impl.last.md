Perfect! All the files I referenced exist. Now let me check if there are any verification commands I should run:

The spec mentions no specific verification commands (format, lint, test are all empty), so let me create a summary of the changes:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented C00-15 by creating comprehensive documentation for the plugin's boot sequence.

### Files Created:
1. **`docs/boot-sequence.md`** - A detailed documentation file describing:
   - The three-phase initialization approach (Requirements → Container/Providers → Context-Specific Boot)
   - Phase 1: Requirements validation (PHP 8.1+, WordPress 6.0+, WooCommerce 8.0+)
   - Phase 2: Container initialization and service provider registration/boot
   - Detailed explanation of all 20 service providers in registration order
   - Phase 3: Context-specific runtime behavior for conversation management
   - Key architectural patterns (fail-fast, two-phase initialization, dependency injection, provider ordering, immutable context, singleton pattern)
   - Database schema initialization
   - Extension points for third-party developers
   - Complete boot sequence flow diagram
   
### Files Modified:
1. **`docs/README.md`** - Added link to the new boot sequence documentation in the "For Developers" section

### Documentation Accuracy:
All references in the documentation are to **real files and classes** in the codebase:
- `whatsapp-commerce-hub.php` (main plugin file with line references)
- `includes/Container/Container.php` (PSR-11 container)
- `includes/Container/ServiceProviderInterface.php` (provider interface)
- All 20 service providers in `includes/Providers/`
- `includes/ValueObjects/ConversationContext.php` (conversation state)
- `includes/Application/Services/ContextManagerService.php` (context persistence)
- `includes/Infrastructure/Database/DatabaseManager.php` (schema management)

## How to Verify

1. **Read the documentation**:
   ```bash
   cat docs/boot-sequence.md
   ```

2. **Verify the link was added to README**:
   ```bash
   grep "Boot Sequence" docs/README.md
   ```

3. **Confirm all referenced files exist**:
   ```bash
   ls -l whatsapp-commerce-hub.php
   ls -l includes/Container/Container.php
   ls -l includes/Providers/*.php | wc -l  # Should show 20 providers
   ls -l includes/ValueObjects/ConversationContext.php
   ls -l includes/Application/Services/ContextManagerService.php
   ls -l includes/Infrastructure/Database/DatabaseManager.php
   ```

4. **Review the boot sequence flow matches the code**:
   - Check main plugin file line 404-426 for plugins_loaded hook
   - Check line 295-330 for requirements validation
   - Check line 85-144 for container initialization
   - Check line 94-126 for provider registration order

## Risks / Follow-ups

**Risks**: None. This is pure documentation with no code changes.

**Follow-ups**:
- Consider creating additional diagrams (sequence diagrams, class diagrams) to visualize the boot process
- Add examples of common extension scenarios using the documented hooks
- Link to this boot sequence doc from other developer docs (api-reference.md, extending.md, hooks-reference.md) where relevant
- Consider adding troubleshooting section for common boot-related issues
