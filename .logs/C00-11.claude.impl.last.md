Perfect! All the references to these tables in the code will now work correctly because the tables will be created during installation. Let me create a final summary:

## Status: DONE ✓

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented C00-11 by adding four missing database tables to the DatabaseManager installation routine:

1. **wch_rate_limits** - Rate limiting table for API/webhook/security operations
2. **wch_security_log** - Security event audit trail  
3. **wch_webhook_idempotency** - Webhook/notification deduplication
4. **wch_webhook_events** - Payment webhook processing tracker

### Files Modified
- `includes/Infrastructure/Database/DatabaseManager.php` (+98 lines)
  - Added 4 new table schema methods
  - Updated `getTableSchemas()` to include new tables
  - Updated `dropTables()` to drop new tables on uninstall
- `docs/db-schema.md` (+115 lines)
  - Documented all 4 new tables with complete schema details
  - Updated table numbering and summary statistics
  - Added migration summary showing integrated tables

### Files Created
- `test-db-tables.php` - Verification script to test table creation

## How to Verify

### Automatic Verification (Recommended)
Run the test script:
```bash
wp eval-file test-db-tables.php
```

Expected result: All 4 tables should be created and verified successfully.

### Manual Verification
1. **Activate/Re-activate plugin** - Tables will be created automatically
2. **Check tables exist:**
```sql
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_wch_rate_limits';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_wch_security_log';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_wch_webhook_idempotency';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_wch_webhook_events';
```

3. **Test functionality:**
- Use RateLimiter API - should work without missing table errors
- Trigger security events - should log to wch_security_log
- Send webhooks - should deduplicate using wch_webhook_idempotency
- Process payment webhooks - should track in wch_webhook_events

### PHP Syntax Check
```bash
php -l includes/Infrastructure/Database/DatabaseManager.php
```
Result: No syntax errors detected ✓

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk
- Implementation uses WordPress `dbDelta()` which is safe and idempotent
- All schemas match existing code usage patterns
- Tables follow same lifecycle as other core plugin tables

### Follow-ups
1. **Existing Installations:** Users who already have the plugin installed will get tables created automatically when:
   - Plugin is re-activated, OR
   - Migrations run on `admin_init` (automatic)

2. **Optional Deprecation:** The static method `PriorityQueue::createRateLimitsTable()` can now be deprecated since the table is created by DatabaseManager.

3. **Remaining Optional Tables:** Three auxiliary tables remain separate (created on-demand):
   - wch_dead_letter_queue
   - wch_circuit_breakers  
   - wch_saga_state
   
   These are advanced features and don't require immediate integration.

## Acceptance Criteria Met ✓
- ✓ wch_rate_limits table added with schema + install/uninstall support
- ✓ wch_security_log table added with schema + install/uninstall support  
- ✓ wch_webhook_idempotency table added with schema + install/uninstall support
- ✓ wch_webhook_events table added with schema + install/uninstall support
- ✓ Security/RateLimiter/Idempotency/Payment webhooks will not hit missing-table errors
- ✓ Documentation updated in db-schema.md
