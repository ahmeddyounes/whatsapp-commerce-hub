## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully resolved the container alias collision issue and added a duplicate detection guard. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **Resolved 'wch.checkout' Alias Collision**
   - **Problem**: Both `BusinessServiceProvider` and `SagaServiceProvider` registered the `'wch.checkout'` alias, causing the second registration (SagaServiceProvider) to silently overwrite the first
   - **Solution**: Renamed the saga version to `'wch.checkout.saga'` in `includes/Providers/SagaServiceProvider.php:67,135`
   - **Result**: 
     - `'wch.checkout'` → `CheckoutOrchestratorInterface` (BusinessServiceProvider)
     - `'wch.checkout.saga'` → `CheckoutSaga` (SagaServiceProvider)

### 2. **Added Dev-Only Duplicate Detection Guard**
   - **File**: `includes/Container/Container.php:128-152`
   - **Implementation**: Added guard in `bind()` method that:
     - Only activates when `WP_DEBUG` is enabled
     - Detects duplicate string alias registrations (excludes class/interface rebindings)
     - Triggers `E_USER_WARNING` with descriptive message
     - Does not block the binding (allows intentional overrides) but warns developers
   
### 3. **Verified Container Boot Determinism**
   - Audited all 20 service providers
   - Confirmed no other alias collisions exist
   - All `'wch.*'` aliases are now unique across providers
   - Container boot order is deterministic and documented

## Files Modified

1. `includes/Container/Container.php` - Added duplicate alias detection guard
2. `includes/Providers/SagaServiceProvider.php` - Renamed `'wch.checkout'` to `'wch.checkout.saga'`

## How to Verify

### Manual Verification:
```bash
# 1. Check for no duplicate 'wch.*' aliases across providers
grep -h "'wch\." includes/Providers/*.php | grep -E "^\s+'wch\." | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | grep -v "^\s*2 "

# Expected: Empty output (all aliases appear exactly 2x: once in register(), once in provides())
```

### Runtime Verification (with WP_DEBUG enabled):
```bash
# The duplicate detection guard will trigger a warning if any provider 
# attempts to re-register an existing alias during container boot
# 
# Before this fix, the warning would have appeared for 'wch.checkout'
# After this fix, no warnings should appear
```

### Code Inspection:
```bash
# Verify BusinessServiceProvider still has 'wch.checkout'
grep "'wch.checkout'" includes/Providers/BusinessServiceProvider.php

# Verify SagaServiceProvider now has 'wch.checkout.saga'
grep "'wch.checkout" includes/Providers/SagaServiceProvider.php
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk:
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing code uses `CheckoutSaga::class` (the class constant) rather than the string alias `'wch.checkout'`, so the rename doesn't break anything
- **Backward Compatible**: The `'wch.checkout'` alias still exists and points to `CheckoutOrchestratorInterface` as originally intended

### Follow-ups:
1. **Task C02-06** mentioned in the codebase addresses the broader architectural question: "Clarify the relationship between `Checkout\CheckoutOrchestrator`, `Application\Services\Checkout\CheckoutOrchestrator`, and `Sagas\CheckoutSaga`"
2. **Documentation**: Consider documenting the alias naming convention:
   - `'wch.checkout'` → Legacy/primary checkout orchestrator
   - `'wch.checkout.saga'` → Saga-based checkout orchestrator
3. **Future Prevention**: The new guard will catch any future duplicate alias registrations during development (when `WP_DEBUG` is enabled)

## Acceptance Criteria Met:
✅ No duplicated alias keys across providers  
✅ Container boot is deterministic  
✅ Lightweight dev-only guard detects duplicate alias usage during provider registration
