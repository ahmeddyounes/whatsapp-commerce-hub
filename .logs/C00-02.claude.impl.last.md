Perfect! Let me create a summary of the implementation:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully consolidated plugin initialization to eliminate duplication between `WhatsAppCommerceHubPlugin::init()` and service providers. The boot process now follows a single, clear initialization path where service providers own the initialization of their services.

### Changes Made:

**File: `whatsapp-commerce-hub.php`**

1. **Removed Duplicate Initialization (lines 218-250):**
   - Removed duplicate admin page initialization (InboxPage, LogsPage, JobsPage, TemplatesPage, AnalyticsPage, CatalogSyncPage, DashboardWidgets)
   - Removed duplicate service initialization (QueueManager, RefundService, NotificationService, RecoveryService, ReengagementOrchestrator)
   - Removed non-existent method call (`schedule_discrepancy_check()` on InventorySyncService)
   - Removed redundant service resolution (PaymentGatewayRegistry)

2. **Updated Documentation:**
   - Enhanced `wch_get_container()` docblock with detailed bootstrap process documentation
   - Added clear 7-step initialization flow explanation
   - Updated `WhatsAppCommerceHubPlugin::init()` docblock to clarify its minimal role
   - Added comment explaining that providers handle all initialization during boot phase

3. **Simplified Plugin Init Method:**
   - Now only handles 3 core WordPress hooks:
     - `init` → load_textdomain()
     - `admin_init` → check_database_migrations()
     - `woocommerce_checkout_order_created` → track_order_conversion()

### Initialization Flow (Now Clear and Documented):

1. Container is created
2. Service providers are registered (bindings created, not initialized)
3. `wch_container_registered` action fires
4. Container `boot()` calls each provider's `boot()` method
5. During boot, providers initialize:
   - Admin pages (AdminServiceProvider)
   - Queue processors and schedules (QueueServiceProvider)
   - Service hooks and schedulers (various providers)
6. `wch_container_booted` action fires
7. WhatsAppCommerceHubPlugin singleton is created with minimal initialization

## How to Verify

### Syntax Check:
```bash
php -l whatsapp-commerce-hub.php
```

### Manual Testing:
1. Activate the plugin in a WordPress environment with WooCommerce
2. Verify admin pages load correctly:
   - WP Admin → WhatsApp Hub → Inbox
   - WP Admin → WhatsApp Hub → Logs
   - WP Admin → WhatsApp Hub → Jobs
   - WP Admin → WhatsApp Hub → Settings
   - WP Admin → WhatsApp Hub → Analytics
   - WP Admin → WhatsApp Hub → Catalog Sync
   - WP Admin → WhatsApp Hub → Broadcasts
3. Verify dashboard widgets appear
4. Verify queue jobs are scheduled (check Action Scheduler)
5. Verify notifications work on order creation
6. Verify abandoned cart recovery is scheduled
7. Verify re-engagement campaigns are scheduled

### Automated Tests:
```bash
# Requires WordPress test suite setup
composer test:unit
composer test:integration
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk:
- All previously initialized services are confirmed to be initialized by their respective providers
- No behavioral changes, only reorganization of initialization flow
- PHP syntax validated successfully

### Follow-ups:
1. **Testing in Live Environment:** Should be tested in a staging environment with WooCommerce active to ensure all hooks fire correctly
2. **Action Scheduler Monitoring:** Verify scheduled jobs are created correctly after activation
3. **Admin Page Access:** Verify all admin pages are accessible and render correctly
4. **Potential Optimization:** Consider lazy-loading some services that are only needed in specific contexts

### Confirmed Provider Coverage:
- ✅ Admin pages → AdminServiceProvider
- ✅ Settings → AdminSettingsServiceProvider  
- ✅ Broadcasts → BroadcastsServiceProvider
- ✅ RecoveryService → BusinessServiceProvider
- ✅ NotificationService → NotificationServiceProvider
- ✅ RefundService → PaymentServiceProvider
- ✅ ProductSync → ProductSyncServiceProvider
- ✅ ReengagementOrchestrator → ReengagementServiceProvider
- ✅ Queue processors → QueueServiceProvider
