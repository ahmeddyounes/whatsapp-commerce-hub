Perfect! Let me create a quick summary of the implementation:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully created comprehensive module map documentation for the WhatsApp Commerce Hub plugin:

### Files Created
1. **docs/module-map.md** (457 lines, 19KB)
   - Comprehensive documentation of all 11 modules
   - Each module includes:
     - Purpose and description
     - Provider entrypoint with file references
     - Key contracts and interfaces
     - Database tables with field descriptions
     - Scheduled jobs
     - WordPress hooks (actions and filters)
   
### Files Modified
2. **docs/README.md**
   - Added link to Module Map in the "For Developers" section
   - Positioned as the first developer documentation link for easy discovery

### Modules Documented
1. **Webhooks** - Webhook ingestion and processing
2. **Conversations/FSM** - Finite state machine for conversation flows
3. **Catalog** - WhatsApp Business Catalog integration
4. **Product Sync** - WooCommerce to WhatsApp product synchronization
5. **Checkout** - Checkout orchestration and order creation
6. **Payments** - Multi-gateway payment processing (COD, Stripe, Razorpay, PIX, WhatsApp Pay)
7. **Broadcasts** - Targeted marketing campaigns
8. **Reengagement** - Customer reactivation campaigns (abandoned cart, back-in-stock, loyalty)
9. **Admin** - WordPress admin interface and settings
10. **Monitoring** - Health checks and system monitoring
11. **Security** - Encryption, rate limiting, and security logging

### Additional Sections
- **Cross-Module Dependencies** - Documents shared tables, services, and event flows
- **Event Flow Example** - Shows how a message flows through multiple modules
- **Related Documentation** - Links to other relevant documentation

## How to Verify

No verification commands were specified in the handoff. The documentation is ready for review:

```bash
# View the module map
cat docs/module-map.md

# Verify it's linked from the main README
grep "Module Map" docs/README.md

# Check file statistics
wc -l docs/module-map.md
ls -lh docs/module-map.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk
- Documentation is accurate based on current codebase analysis
- All file references include relative paths for easy navigation
- Table of contents provides quick navigation to each module

### Potential Follow-ups
1. Keep documentation updated as modules evolve
2. Consider adding sequence diagrams for complex flows
3. May want to add more examples of hook usage
4. Could expand "Cross-Module Dependencies" with more detailed interaction patterns

### Notes
- Documentation follows existing docs style and formatting
- All modules from the spec are comprehensively documented
- Includes practical information (table schemas, job names, hook names) that developers need for extending the plugin
