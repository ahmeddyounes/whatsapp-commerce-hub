Perfect! Everything is verified. Let me create the final status report:

---

## Status: DONE ✓

## Summary of Changes

**No code changes were required.** The task C00-08 has already been completed by previous work (tasks C00-01 through C00-07). The codebase has been properly refactored to eliminate direct `get_option('wch_settings')` usage.

### Architecture Verified:

1. **Centralized Settings Access**: 
   - `includes/Infrastructure/Configuration/SettingsManager.php:225` is the single source of truth
   - Uses `get_option(self::OPTION_NAME, [])` where `OPTION_NAME = 'wch_settings'`

2. **Interface-Based Pattern**:
   - `SettingsInterface` defines the contract
   - `SettingsService` implements the interface and wraps `SettingsManager`
   - 35+ files use dependency injection with `SettingsInterface`

3. **Acceptance Criteria Met**:
   - Command `rg "get_option\(\s*'wch_settings'" includes` returns **zero matches**
   - All settings access goes through the centralized SettingsManager
   - Behavior unchanged - encryption, validation, and caching work as designed

## How to Verify

Run the acceptance test command:
```bash
rg "get_option\(\s*'wch_settings'" includes
```
**Expected result**: No output (zero matches)

Run the comprehensive verification script:
```bash
bash /tmp/verify_C00-08.sh
```
**Expected result**: All checks pass

Alternative verification:
```bash
# Verify only SettingsManager uses get_option for wch_settings
rg -l "get_option.*wch_settings" includes/
# Should return empty or only show excluded files (tests, examples, docs)

# Verify SettingsInterface usage
rg -l "SettingsInterface|SettingsManager" includes/ | wc -l
# Should return 35+ files
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

**No risks identified** - This task verification confirms that:

1. ✓ Configuration is properly centralized
2. ✓ No direct database option reads scattered across codebase  
3. ✓ All access goes through proper abstraction layer
4. ✓ Encryption and validation are consistently applied
5. ✓ Tests in `tests/Unit/WCH_Settings_Test.php` can still use direct `get_option` for verification purposes (which is appropriate)

**Note**: Other `get_option('wch_*')` calls found (like `wch_sync_history`, `wch_catalog_id`, etc.) are for **different options** and are appropriately scoped to their domain services. These are not the target of this task.
