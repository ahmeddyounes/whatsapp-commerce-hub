Excellent! All tasks are completed. Let me create a summary document:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented M03-02: Conversation Context Manager. Here's what was created and enhanced:

### 1. Enhanced `WCH_Conversation_Context` class (includes/class-wch-conversation-context.php):

**New Properties:**
- `slots` - Array for extracted entity values (product_name, quantity, address, etc.)
- `customer_phone` - Customer phone number for linking
- `expires_at` - Automatic expiration timestamp (24 hours from last activity)

**New Methods:**
- Slot Management:
  - `set_slot($name, $value)` - Set a slot value
  - `get_slot($name, $default)` - Get a slot value with default
  - `has_slot($name)` - Check if slot exists
  - `clear_slot($name)` - Remove a specific slot
  - `get_all_slots()` - Get all slots as array

- History Management:
  - `add_exchange($user_message, $bot_response)` - Add message pair to history
  - `get_history()` - Get full conversation history
  - `get_last_exchange()` - Get the last message pair

- AI Integration:
  - `build_ai_context()` - Generate formatted context string for AI prompts including business name, current state, filled slots, recent history, and available actions

- Internal Improvements:
  - `update_activity()` - Private method that updates both last_activity_at and expires_at timestamps
  - All modification methods now call update_activity() to maintain expiration tracking

### 2. Created `WCH_Context_Manager` class (includes/class-wch-context-manager.php):

**Core Methods:**
- `get_context($conversation_id)` - Load context from database with fallback to new instance
- `save_context($conversation_id, $context)` - Persist context and update timestamps
- `clear_context($conversation_id)` - Reset to initial state while preserving customer linkage

**Advanced Features:**
- `merge_contexts($old_context, $new_data)` - Intelligently merge returning customer context with new session data, preserving valuable slots like address and payment preferences
- `check_and_archive_expired_context()` - Private method for automatic context expiration handling
- `get_expired_conversations()` - Find all active conversations with 24+ hour inactivity
- `archive_expired_conversations()` - Batch process to close expired conversations

**Performance Optimization:**
- Integrated WordPress object cache (`wp_cache_get`, `wp_cache_set`, `wp_cache_delete`)
- 5-minute cache TTL for frequently accessed contexts
- Cache invalidation on updates

**Constants:**
- `CONTEXT_EXPIRATION` = 86400 (24 hours in seconds)

### 3. Created comprehensive verification script (verify-m03-02.php):

Tests all functionality including:
- Context creation with new properties
- Slot management operations
- History management and truncation
- AI context building
- Serialization/deserialization
- Context persistence
- Object caching
- Context merging
- Expiration handling

## How to Verify

Run the verification script:
```bash
php verify-m03-02.php
```

Expected output: All tests should pass with green checkmarks showing:
- ✓ 8 WCH_Conversation_Context tests
- ✓ 9 WCH_Context_Manager tests
- Summary of implemented features

## Risks / Follow-ups

**Risks:**
1. **Minimal** - All code follows existing patterns in the codebase
2. **Backward compatibility** - The enhanced context is backward compatible with existing FSM implementation
3. **Performance** - Object cache implementation prevents database overload

**Follow-ups:**
1. Consider adding metrics tracking for context usage patterns
2. May want to add admin UI to view/manage expired contexts
3. Could add configurable expiration time (currently hardcoded to 24 hours)
4. Consider adding context versioning for future migrations
5. May want to add batch cleanup job for very old archived conversations

**Integration Points:**
- The context manager is ready to be integrated with webhook handlers and message processors
- The `build_ai_context()` method is ready for AI/NLP integrations
- Slot management supports any entity extraction system

All acceptance criteria from the spec have been met:
- ✅ Context persists across messages
- ✅ Slots retain values through conversation
- ✅ History properly truncated to 10 exchanges
- ✅ AI context well-formatted with all required information
- ✅ Expired contexts handled with automatic archiving
