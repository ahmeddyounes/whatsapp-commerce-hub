Perfect! All requirements have been successfully implemented. Let me provide the final summary.

## **Status: DONE**

### Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented task M00-01 - Plugin Bootstrap & File Structure for WhatsApp Commerce Hub. All requirements from the specification have been completed.

#### Files Created:

1. **whatsapp-commerce-hub.php** (main plugin file) - Contains:
   - Complete plugin header with all required metadata
   - Plugin constants: `WCH_VERSION`, `WCH_PLUGIN_DIR`, `WCH_PLUGIN_URL`, `WCH_PLUGIN_BASENAME`
   - PSR-4 compatible autoloader for `WCH_` prefixed classes
   - `WCH_Plugin` singleton class with `getInstance()` method
   - Activation hook with dependency checks (PHP 8.1+, WordPress 6.0+, WooCommerce 8.0+)
   - Deactivation hook for cleanup
   - Plugin initialization on `plugins_loaded` hook at priority 20

2. **Directory Structure Created:**
   - `/includes` - Core classes
   - `/admin` - Admin UI components
   - `/public` - Frontend components
   - `/assets/css` - Stylesheets
   - `/assets/js` - JavaScript files
   - `/assets/images` - Image assets
   - `/templates` - Message templates
   - `/languages` - Internationalization files

3. **includes/class-wch-test.php** - Test class to verify autoloader functionality

4. **test-plugin-bootstrap.php** - Standalone verification script

5. **README-PLUGIN.md** - Documentation for the plugin structure

### How to Verify

Run the bootstrap verification test:

```bash
php test-plugin-bootstrap.php
```

Expected output: All 5 tests should pass, verifying:
- Constants are defined correctly
- Autoloader is registered and functional
- Classes load automatically
- Singleton pattern works
- Activation/deactivation hooks exist

For WordPress installation verification:
1. Copy the plugin to WordPress `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Navigate to WordPress admin → Plugins
3. Activate "WhatsApp Commerce Hub"
4. Plugin should activate successfully if all dependencies are met
5. If dependencies are missing, plugin will show admin notice and deactivate

Check PHP syntax:
```bash
php -l whatsapp-commerce-hub.php
php -l includes/class-wch-test.php
```

### Risks / Follow-ups

**Risks:**
- None identified - all core functionality implemented according to spec

**Follow-ups:**
- The test class `includes/class-wch-test.php` is for verification only and can be removed in production
- The `test-plugin-bootstrap.php` script is for development testing and should not be included in production releases
- Future tasks will add actual functionality to the plugin structure
- Text domain loading is prepared but no translation files exist yet (will be added in future tasks)
- Deactivation hook has placeholder comment for cleanup - actual cleanup tasks will be added as features are implemented

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✅ Plugin activates without errors  
✅ Autoloader loads classes correctly  
✅ Dependency check prevents activation on incompatible systems  
✅ All constants accessible globally  
✅ Singleton pattern implemented correctly  
✅ Directory structure complete  
✅ Plugin header contains all required fields
