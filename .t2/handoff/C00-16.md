Agent final message (file: C00-16.claude.impl.last.md):

Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive summary of what was done:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented the repository hygiene policy for empty directories as specified in C00-16. All empty directories have been addressed according to their purpose:

### 1. Added README.md Files (12 directories)

Created comprehensive README.md files for intentional placeholder directories, each explaining:
- Status (Planned/Migration in progress)
- Purpose and intended use
- Migration plan with specific steps
- Current state and why it's empty
- References to architecture documentation

**Directories documented:**
- `includes/Features/Broadcasts/` - Planned broadcast messaging feature
- `includes/Features/Notifications/` - Planned notification system
- `includes/Features/Reengagement/` - Planned customer reengagement feature
- `includes/Features/Payments/Gateways/` - Planned payment gateway integrations
- `includes/Legacy/` - Target for deprecated code during migration
- `includes/Support/Validation/` - Planned validation utilities
- `includes/Infrastructure/Database/Repositories/` - Migration target for repository pattern
- `includes/Infrastructure/Persistence/` - Planned persistence layer abstractions
- `includes/Infrastructure/Api/Clients/` - Migration target for API clients
- `includes/Infrastructure/Api/Rest/Controllers/` - Migration target for REST controllers
- `includes/Presentation/Actions/` - Planned WordPress action handlers
- `includes/Presentation/Admin/Settings/` - Migration target for settings pages

### 2. Removed Unused Directories (2 directories)

Deleted truly empty directories with no clear purpose or references:
- `admin/` - No references found in codebase
- `assets/images/` - Empty subdirectory (parent `assets/` still has css/ and js/)

### 3. Ignored Third-Party Directories

Left vendor directories untouched as they are managed by third-party dependencies:
- `vendor/wp-cli/mustache/vendor/spec` - Part of external dependency

## How to Verify

Run these commands to verify the implementation:

```bash
# Check for empty directories (should return 0 outside vendor/)
find . -type d -empty -not -path '*/vendor/*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/\.*' 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# List all README files in previously empty directories
find includes -name "README.md" -type f | sort

# Verify specific directories now have README files
ls -la includes/Features/Broadcasts/
ls -la includes/Infrastructure/Api/Clients/
ls -la includes/Legacy/

# Verify removed directories no longer exist
ls admin 2>&1 | grep "No such file"
ls assets/images 2>&1 | grep "No such file"
```

**Expected results:**
- 0 empty directories outside vendor/
- 12+ README.md files documenting placeholder directories
- All READMEs include status, purpose, migration plan, and references
- `admin/` and `assets/images/` no longer exist

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk
- **Third-party dependency updates**: The `vendor/wp-cli/mustache/vendor/spec` directory was intentionally left alone as it's part of a third-party package. Future composer updates may affect it, but that's expected behavior.

### Follow-ups
1. **Monitor directory usage**: As the architecture migration progresses (per `docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md`), these placeholder directories will be populated. Track which phase populates which directory.

2. **Update as migration progresses**: When directories get populated with actual code:
   - Remove or update the README.md to reflect the new state
   - Update status from "Planned" to "In progress" or "Active"

3. **CI check consideration**: Consider adding a pre-commit hook or CI check to ensure new empty directories include README.md files explaining their purpose.

4. **Architecture plan sync**: The READMEs reference specific phases in `docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md`. As that plan evolves, update the corresponding README files to maintain accuracy.

5. **Migration tracking**: Several directories indicate "migration in progress" status. These migrations should be tracked:
   - `includes/Repositories/` → `includes/Infrastructure/Database/Repositories/`
   - `includes/Clients/` → `includes/Infrastructure/Api/Clients/`
   - `includes/Controllers/` → `includes/Infrastructure/Api/Rest/Controllers/`
